README EX3
===========

1. What was Hard?
   ==============
   We found it hard to understand in generall what we are required to do in this exercise.
   We had to read the description of the exercise several time till we understand what we 
   had to implement and the different parts of each module. 

2. What was fun?
   =============
   - To actually understand how real server works.
   - The template code was really helpful.

3. how we tested our server?
   =========================
   We mainely tested our server using the 3 examples commands that we had to write in the test.js,
   (i.e "/hello/world", "add/:n/:m", "filez/*" commands).
   With the command "filez/*" we had a lot of posibilities to test our server, we created a lot of files
   and directories and also recursive directories and checked the outputs.
